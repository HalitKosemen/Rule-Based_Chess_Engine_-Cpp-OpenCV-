## Rule-Based Chess Engine (C++ / OpenCV)

This project is a **rule-based chess engine implemented in C++**, featuring an  
**interactive graphical interface built with OpenCV**.

All chess rules are **explicitly implemented from scratch**, without using any
external chess engines or AI libraries.

The application allows users to **interact with the board using mouse input**,
visualize legal moves, and play a complete game of chess while the engine enforces
all standard rules.

### ♟ Key Features
- Full **rule-based chess logic**
- **Legal move generation** for all pieces
- **Check detection and illegal move prevention**
- **Castling and pawn promotion support**
- **Interactive OpenCV-based GUI**
- Mouse-based piece selection and movement

---

### 🧠 Engine Details
- No AI or machine learning is used
- All move validation and rule enforcement are **manually implemented in C++**
- Each piece has its own move-generation logic
- Board state and attack squares are evaluated in real time

### 🖥 Visualization
The chessboard and pieces are rendered using **OpenCV**, providing a lightweight
and platform-independent graphical interface without relying on external GUI frameworks.
